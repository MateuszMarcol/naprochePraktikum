# Russell's paradox

[read preliminaries.ftl]

Theorem Russell.
If every class is a set then we have a contradiction.

Proof.
  Assume that every class is a set.
  Define R = {x | x is a set such that x is not an element of x}.
  Then R is a set.
  Hence R is an element of R iff R is not an element of R.
  Contradiction.
Qed.
