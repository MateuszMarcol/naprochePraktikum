README:

This folder contains a selection of example formalizations in the Naproche naturallanguage proof checking system. The examples come in two dialects of the ForTheL controllednatural language: .ftl files use ASCII formating and are close to the original ForTheL language of the System for Automated Deduction (SAD); .ftl.tex files use standard LaTeX commands and can directly be typeset by LaTeX using appropriate preambles and style files.

The examples are chosen to demonstrate possibilities of the current Naproche which is included as a component in the Isabelle 2021-1 platform. The examples include single files devoted to single theorems from mathematical fields like number theory or analysis as well as groups of formalizations on arithmetic or set theory interlinked by "read" commands. There are also some odd examples about a mutilated checkerboard or recreational puzzles.

A main emphasis is on the presentation of naturally readable formalizations in LaTeX which we include as pdf-printouts. Putting arbitrary LaTeX material around the actual formalizations allows a literary style of documents which includes explanations and even graphics. The further development of Naproche will focus on the .ftl.tex format in order to build readable libraries of computer-verified mathematics. The classical .ftl format will be kept up for some time since it allows rapid experiments without worrying about LaTeX particulars. Over time, however, the formats will diverge, as we are going to extract semantic context out of typesetting information (parsing depending on LaTeX text versus math mode, matrix notation, ...).

Observe that Naproche is putting high demands on computing resources, since its checking mechanisms involve the continuous operation of an ATP server. Computers satisfying the recommendations for running Isabelle should be able to run our formalizations. On weaker systems successful checking of texts may require stopping other resource-heavy processes or even adding intermediate proof steps.
