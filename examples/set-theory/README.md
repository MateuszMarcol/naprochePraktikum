## Technical note

The file `set-theory.aux` must be kept in this directory in order to allow for
references to labels defined in `set-theory.tex` (and its subfiles) via the
LaTeX package `xr`. Such a "cross-document" reference is for instance used in
`$NAPROCHE/examples/cantor-schroeder-bernstein.ftl.tex`.
