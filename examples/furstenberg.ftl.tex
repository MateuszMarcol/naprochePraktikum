  \noindent This is a formalization of Furstenberg's topological proof of the
  infinitude of primes \cite[p. 353]{Furstenberg1955}.
  On mid-range hardware \Naproche needs approximately 5 Minutes to verify this
  formalization plus approximately 30 minutes to verify the library files it
  depends on.

  The central idea of Furstenberg's proof is to define a certain topology on
  $\Nat$ from the properties of which we can deduce that the set of
  primes is infinite.\footnote{Actually, Furstenberg's proof makes use of a
  topology on $\Int$. But this topology can as well be restricted to
  $\Nat$ without substantially changing the proof.}

  \begin{forthel}
    Let $n, m, k$ denote natural numbers.
    Let $p, q$ denote nonzero natural numbers.

    \begin{definition}
      Let $A$ be a subset of $\Nat$.
      $A^{\complement} = \Nat \setminus A$.
    \end{definition}

    Let the complement of $A$ stand for $A^{\complement}$.

    \begin{lemma}
      The complement of any subset of $\Nat$ is a subset of $\Nat$.
    \end{lemma}
  \end{forthel}

  Towards a suitable topology on $\Nat$ let us define \textit{arithmetic
  sequences} $\N_{n, q}$ on $\Nat$.

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
      $\N_{n, q} = \{ m \in \Nat \mid m \equiv n \pmod{q} \}$.
    \end{definition}
  \end{forthel}

  This allows us to define the \textit{evenly spaced natural number
  topology} on $\Nat$, whose open sets are defined as follows.

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
      Let $U$ be a subset of $\Nat$.
      $U$ is open iff for any $n \in U$ there exists a $q$ such that
      $\N_{n, q} \subseteq U$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
      A system of open sets is a system of sets $S$ such that every element of
      $S$ is an open subset of $\Nat$.
    \end{definition}
  \end{forthel}

  We can show that the open sets form a topology on $\Nat$.

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{lemma}
      $\Nat$ and $\emptyset$ are open.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{lemma}
      Let $U,V$ be open subsets of $\Nat$.
      Then $U \cap V$ is open.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      Let $n \in U \cap V$.
      Take a $q$ such that $\N_{n, q} \subseteq U$.
      Take a $p$ such that $\N_{n, p} \subseteq V$.
      Then $p \cdot q \neq 0$.

      Let us show that $\N_{n, p \cdot q} \subseteq U \cap V$.
        Let $m \in \N_{n, p \cdot q}$.
        We have $m \equiv n \pmod{p \cdot q}$.
        Hence $m \equiv n \pmod{p}$ and $m \equiv n \pmod{q}$.
        Thus $m \in \N_{n, p}$ and $m \in \N_{n, q}$.
        Therefore $m \in U$ and $m \in V$.
        Consequently $m \in U \cap V$.
      End.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
      Let $S$ be a system of open sets.
      Then $\bigcup S$ is open.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      Let $n \in \bigcup S$.
      Take a set $M$ such that $n \in M \in S$.
      Consider a $q$ such that $\N_{n, q} \subseteq M$.
      Then $\N_{n, q} \subseteq \bigcup S$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{forthel}

  Now that we have a topology of open sets on $\Nat$, we can continue
  with a characterization of closed sets.
  Their key property is that they are closed under \textit{finite} unions.
  Since we cannot provide a proper definition of finiteness in the context of
  this formalization, we cannot prove this closedness condition.
  All we can do is to prove that the union of \textit{two} closed sets remains
  closed.
  Having shown this little fact we will introduce the notion of finiteness
  axiomatically and state that every finite union of closed sets is indeed
  closed.
  Actually this condition plus the fact that sets which are equinumerous to an
  infinite set are also infinite is all we need to know about the notion of
  finiteness to prove that there are infinitely many primes.

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
      Let $A$ be a subset of $\Nat$.
      $A$ is closed iff $A^{\complement}$ is open.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
      A system of closed sets is a system of sets $S$ such that every element of
      $S$ is a closed subset of $\Nat$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}
      Let $A,B$ be closed subsets of $\Nat$.
      Then $A \cup B$ is closed.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      % The LHS of the following equation must be put in parentheses due to a
      % bug in Naproche's parser.
      We have $((A \cup B)^{\complement}) = A^{\complement} \cap B^{\complement}$.
      $A^{\complement}$ and $B^{\complement}$ are open.
      Hence $A^{\complement} \cap B^{\complement}$ is open.
      Thus $A \cup B$ is closed.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{signature}
      Let $X$ be a class.
      $X$ is finite is an atom.
    \end{signature}

    Let $X$ is infinite stand for $X$ is not finite.

    \begin{axiom}
      Let $S$ be a finite system of closed sets.
      Then $\bigcup S$ is closed.
    \end{axiom}

    \begin{axiom}
      Let $X, Y$ be classes.
      If $X$ is infinite and $X$ is equinumerous to $Y$ then $Y$ is infinite.
    \end{axiom}
  \end{forthel}

  An important step towards Furstenberg's proof is to show that arithmetic
  sequences are closed.

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{lemma}
      $\N_{n, q}$ is closed.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      Let $m \in (\N_{n, q})^{\complement}$.

      Let us show that $\N_{m, q} \subseteq (\N_{n, q})^{\complement}$.
        Let $k \in \N_{m, q}$.
        Assume $k \notin (\N_{n, q})^{\complement}$.
        Then $k \equiv m \pmod{q}$ and $n \equiv k \pmod{q}$.
        Hence $m \equiv n \pmod{q}$.
        Therefore $m \in \N_{n, q}$.
        Contradiction.
      End.
    \end{proof}
  \end{forthel}

  Identifying each prime number $p$ with the arithmetic sequence $\N_{0, p}$
  yields a bijection between the set $\Prime$ of all prime numbers and the set
  $\Ps$ of all such sequences $\N_{0, p}$.
  Thus to show that there are infinitely many primes it suffices to show that
  $\Ps$ is infinite.

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{definition}
      $\Ps = \{ \N_{0, p} \mid p \in \Prime \}$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}
      $\Ps$ is a system of closed sets.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      $\N_{0, p}$ is a closed subset of $\Nat$ for every $p \in \Prime$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
      $\Ps$ is a set that is equinumerous to $\Prime$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      (1) $\Ps$ is a set.
      Indeed $\Ps \subseteq \pow(\Nat)$.

      (2) $\Ps$ is equinumerous to $\Prime$. \\
      Proof.
        Define $f(p) = \N_{0,p}$ for $p \in \Prime$.

        Let us show that $f$ is injective.
          Let $p, q \in \Prime$.
          Assume $f(p) = f(q)$.
          Then $\N_{0, p} = \N_{0, q}$.
          We have $\N_{0, p} = \{ m \in \Nat \mid m \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \}$ and
          $\N_{0, q} = \{ m \in \Nat \mid m \equiv 0 \pmod{q} \}$.
          Hence for all $m \in \Nat$ we have $m \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ iff
          $m \equiv 0 \pmod{q}$.
          Thus for all $m \in \Nat$ we have $m \mod p = 0 \mod p$ iff
          $m \mod q = 0 \mod q$.
          We have $0 \mod p = 0 = 0 \mod q$.
          Hence for all $m \in \Nat$ we have $m \mod p = 0$ iff $m \mod q = 0$.
          Thus for all $m \in \Nat$ we have $p \mid m$ iff $q \mid m$.
          Therefore $p = q$.
        End.

        $f$ is surjective onto $\Ps$.
        Thus $f$ is a bijection between $\Prime$ and $\Ps$.
      Qed.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}[Furstenberg]
      $\Prime$ is infinite.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      $\bigcup \Ps$ is a subset of $\Nat$.

      Let us show that for any $n \in \Nat$ we have $n \in \bigcup \Ps$ iff $n$
      has a prime divisor.
        Let $n \in \Nat$.

        If $n$ has a prime divisor then $n$ belongs to $\bigcup \Ps$. \\
        Proof.
          Assume $n$ has a prime divisor.
          Take a prime divisor $p$ of $n$.
          We have $\N_{0, p} \in \Ps$.
          Hence $n \in \N_{0, p}$.
        Qed.

        If $n$ belongs to $\bigcup \Ps$ then $n$ has a prime divisor. \\
        Proof.
          Assume that $n$ belongs to $\bigcup \Ps$.
          Take a prime number $r$ such that $n \in \N_{0, r}$.
          Hence $n \equiv 0 \pmod{r}$.
          Thus $n \mod r = 0 \mod r = 0$.
          Therefore $r$ is a prime divisor of $n$.
        Qed.
      End.

      Hence For all $n \in \Nat$ we have $n \in (\bigcup \Ps)^{\complement}$ iff
      $n$ has no prime divisor.
      Therefore $(\bigcup \Ps)^{\complement} = \set{1}$.
      Indeed any natural number having no prime divisor is equal to $1$.

      $\Ps$ is infinite. \\
      Proof by contradiction.
        Assume that $\Ps$ is finite.
        Then $\bigcup \Ps$ is closed and $(\bigcup \Ps)^{\complement}$ is open.
        Take a $p$ such that $\N_{1, p} \subseteq (\bigcup \Ps)^{\complement}$.
        $1 + p$ is an element of $\N_{1, p}$.
        Indeed $1 + p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$
        (by \ref{ARITHMETIC_08_5984712287846400}).
        $1 + p$ is not equal to $1$.
        Hence $1 + p \notin (\bigcup \Ps)^{\complement}$.
        Contradiction.
      Qed.
    \end{proof}
