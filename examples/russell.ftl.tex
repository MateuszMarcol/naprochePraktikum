  Russell's paradox is the assertion that every set theory that contains an
  unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions.
  In terms of \textit{sets} and \textit{classes} it can be phrased as follows.

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{theorem}[Russell]
      If every class is a set then we have a contradiction.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
      Assume that every class is a set.
      Define \[ R = \class{x | \text{$x$ is a set such that $x \notin x$}}. \]
      Then $R$ is a set.
      Hence $R \in R$ iff $R \notin R$.
      Contradiction.
    \end{proof}
  \end{forthel}
\end{document}
